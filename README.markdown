#Introduction
This project started life when I decided to learn javascript after reading <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rhino-on-rails.html">Steve Yegge's post on Rhino on Rails</a>. Rather then wait for Steve to release RoR (he still hasn't) I decided to write a _very_ simplified version myself.

This is another MVC framework. It uses javascript on the server side and its powered by rhino. You can do stuff quickly because latte has a fast REPL cycle and because convention is favored over configuration.

I am currently using latte to power <http://www.edomame.com>, my personal website. Check out the code at <http://www.github.com/esh/edomame> to see a full webapp built on latte.

#Dependencies
